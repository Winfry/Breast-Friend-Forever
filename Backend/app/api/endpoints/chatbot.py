1. **Visual Inspection (in mirror):**
   - Stand with arms at your sides, look for changes in size, shape, or contour
   - Raise arms overhead, check for the same changes
   - Look for skin dimpling, redness, rash, or nipple changes

2. **Manual Examination (lying down):**
   - Lie down with pillow under right shoulder, right arm behind head
   - Use left hand fingers to feel right breast in small circular motions
   - Cover entire breast from collarbone to abdomen, armpit to breastbone
   - Repeat on left side

3. **Manual Examination (standing/sitting):**
   - Repeat same process while standing or in shower
   - Many women find wet, soapy skin makes examination easier

**When to examine:** Monthly, 3-5 days after your period ends
**What to look for:** New lumps, thickening, swelling, dimpling, pain, nipple changes
**Important:** This complements but doesn't replace clinical exams!"""

‚Ä¢ Pulling in of nipple or pain in nipple area

- Maintain healthy weight

- Limit alcohol consumption
- Avoid smoking

- Eat balanced diet rich in fruits/vegetables
- Regular screenings after age 40 (earlier if high risk)

üéóÔ∏è **For African women specifically:**
- Know your genetic risk factors
- Start screenings earlier if family history exists
- Advocate for yourself in healthcare settings
- Participate in community awareness programs
- Understand that dense breast tissue may require additional screening
