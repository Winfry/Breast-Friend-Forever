1. **Visual Inspection (in mirror):**

   - Look for skin dimpling, redness, rash, or nipple changes

2. **Manual Examination (lying down):**
   - Lie down with pillow under right shoulder, right arm behind head
   - Use left hand fingers to feel right breast in small circular motions
   - Cover entire breast from collarbone to abdomen
   - Repeat on left side

3. **Manual Examination (standing):**
   - Repeat in shower with wet, soapy skin
